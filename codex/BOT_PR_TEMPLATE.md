Dream Compiler Pull Request
Description
Provide a clear and concise description of the changes in this pull request. Specify the new features, bug fixes, or improvements made to the Dream compiler, which is written in Zig and compiles .dr files (C#-like, semicolon-based syntax) to C code. Reference the main goal: creating a robust compiler for the Dream language.
Example:

Implemented if statement support in dream.zig.
Updated lexer and parser to handle if (condition) { ... } syntax.
Generated corresponding C code for conditional branching.

Related Files
List all modified or added files, including:

dream.zig: Changes to the compiler’s lexer, parser, or codegen.
/docs/*.md: New or updated documentation for features (e.g., /docs/if.md).
/tests/*.dr: New test cases (e.g., /tests/test_if.dr).
_startup.sh: Updates to dependencies if new tools are required.
go.sh: Updates to the agent’s workflow if needed.

Example:

Modified: dream.zig
Added: /docs/if.md
Added: /tests/test_if.dr

Changes
Detail the specific changes made, including:

New features added to the Dream language (e.g., syntax, semantics).
Updates to the Zig compiler code (lexer, parser, or C codegen).
New or updated documentation in /docs.
New test cases in /tests and their expected outputs.
Dependency changes in _startup.sh (added or removed).

Example:

Added if statement parsing in parse_statement.
Generated C code using if and goto for control flow.
Created /docs/if.md with syntax and examples.
Added /tests/test_if.dr to verify if behavior (e.g., if (x > 5) { Console.WriteLine(x); }).
Updated _startup.sh to include zig if not already present.

Testing
Confirm that all tests in /tests pass:

Run bash go.sh to execute the agent’s workflow.
Verify that dream.zig compiles: zig build-exe dream.zig.
For each test file (/tests/*.dr):
Run dream <test>.dr to generate <test>.c.
Compile C code: gcc <test>.c -o <test>.
Execute ./<test> and verify output matches expectations (e.g., // Expected: <value> comments).


Ensure no errors in compilation, linking, or execution.

Example:

Ran go.sh.
Tested /tests/test_if.dr: Outputs 10 when x = 10 and condition x > 5 is true.
All tests passed with no errors.

Dependencies
List any changes to dependencies in _startup.sh:

New tools added (e.g., zig for compilation).
Unused tools removed (e.g., via apt autoremove).

Example:

Added zig to _startup.sh: sudo apt install zig.
No dependencies removed.

Documentation
Confirm that documentation is updated:

New feature documented in /docs/<feature>.md with syntax and examples.
/docs/usage.md updated to reflect new syntax.
/docs/changelog.md updated with version and change details.

Example:

Added /docs/if.md with if statement syntax and examples.
Updated /docs/usage.md to include if syntax.
Added entry to /docs/changelog.md for version 0.2.

Checklist

Code compiles without errors (zig build-exe dream.zig).
All tests in /tests pass.
Documentation updated in /docs.
_startup.sh updated if dependencies changed.
Changes align with C#-like, semicolon-based syntax.
Generated C code is correct and compiles with gcc.

Additional Notes
Add any relevant notes, such as:

Known limitations (e.g., Console.WriteLine outputs raw values).
Future improvements planned.
Issues encountered and workarounds.

Example:

Current Console.WriteLine outputs raw integers; string formatting planned for next iteration.
Tested in Ubuntu 22.04; WSL compatibility verified.
