# Outstanding Tasks

The test suite shows many language constructs are still missing. The following features currently produce errors or warnings and need full implementation:

- Arrays and array initialisation for all primitive types
- Bitwise operators and compound assignment
- Increment/decrement operators and logical operators
- `do` and `for` loops plus the `continue` statement
- `switch` statements
- Functions with parameters and typed return values
- `return` statements
- Classes, structs and object creation
- The ternary `?:` operator
- String concatenation

Keep the grammar and documentation up to date once these features land.
