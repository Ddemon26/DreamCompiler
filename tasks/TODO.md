# Outstanding Tasks

The test suite shows many language constructs are still missing. The following features currently produce errors or warnings and need full implementation:

- Arrays and array initialisation for all primitive types
- `switch` statements
- Functions with parameters and typed return values
- Classes, structs and object creation
- The ternary `?:` operator

Keep the grammar and documentation up to date once these features land.
