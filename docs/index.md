# Dream Documentation

Welcome to the Dream project. This site is split into two main sections:

- **[Compiler Docs](compiler/index.md)** – build instructions, architecture notes and developer guides.
- **[Dream.dr Language](language/index.md)** – syntax overview, examples and standard library information. See that page for a detailed table of contents.

See the [Changelog](changelog.md) for recent updates.
