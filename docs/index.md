# Dream Compiler & Language Documentation

**DreamCompiler** is a modern, high-performance compiler that translates Dream language (`.dr`) source files into optimized C code using Zig as the build system. The compilation pipeline produces portable C code that compiles to native executables.

## What is Dream?

Dream is a C#-style programming language designed for systems programming with modern language features. It combines the performance of C with the developer experience of high-level languages.

```dream
// Hello World in Dream
func main() {
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
}
```

## Architecture Overview

```
.dr files ‚Üí DreamCompiler ‚Üí Portable C ‚Üí zig cc ‚Üí Native Executable
```

The compiler implements a full compilation pipeline:
- **Lexical Analysis** - re2c-generated tokenizer
- **Parsing** - Pratt parser with comprehensive error recovery
- **Semantic Analysis** - Type checking and symbol resolution  
- **IR Generation** - SSA-based three-address intermediate representation
- **Optimization** - Multiple passes including SCCP, DCE, LICM, CSE
- **Code Generation** - Clean, readable C code output

## Key Features

### Language Features
- **Static Typing** - `int`, `float`, `bool`, `char`, `string`, arrays, classes
- **Modern Control Flow** - if/else, loops, switch, exception handling
- **Object-Oriented** - Classes, structs, inheritance
- **Multi-file Compilation** - Module system with import/export
- **Memory Management** - Reference-counted automatic memory management

### Compiler Features
- **Cross-Platform** - Windows, Linux, macOS support
- **Fast Compilation** - Optimized compilation pipeline
- **Debug Support** - Line mapping for source-level debugging
- **IDE Integration** - IntelliSense and language server support
- **Comprehensive Testing** - 100+ automated test cases

## Current Version: v1.1.12

The latest stable release is **DreamCompiler v1.1.12**, featuring complete multi-file compilation, advanced optimization, and comprehensive language support.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Test Pass Rate |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Linux    | Full Support | ~95% |
| Windows  | Stable | ~85% |
| macOS    | In Development | TBD |

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/company/DreamCompiler
cd DreamCompiler

# Build the compiler
zig build

# Run a simple program
zig build run -- examples/hello.dr
```

### Your First Program
Create a file called `hello.dr`:

```dream
func main() {
    string name = Console.ReadLine();
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```

Compile and run:
```bash
zig build run -- hello.dr
cd build/bin && ./hello
```
