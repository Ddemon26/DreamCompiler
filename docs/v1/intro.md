# Introduction to Dream

Dream is a small experimental programming language with C#-like syntax. The Dream compiler translates `.dr` files into C code which is then built into an executable using Zig.

This short guide explains the purpose of Dream and points you to the rest of the documentation for details on each language feature.

- Dream aims to be easy to read with semicolon-terminated statements.
- Dream currently supports `int` and `string` variable types.
 - Control flow includes `if` statements, `while` loops and `do-while` loops with braced blocks.
