# Indexed string initialization checkpoint

P0014 qualifies one ownership boundary: a scalar `string` declaration whose
initializer is an index expression, for example `string text = values[i]`.
The generated code calls `dream_string_copy` once on the selected element.
This applies to ordinary programs and module entries, including pointer-taking
methods and nested blocks. A top-level declaration also copies the element.

## Storage contract

| Storage | Current implementation | Indexed scalar initializer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| String literal | C static storage, no `DrRef` header | Copy bytes into a new managed allocation |
| Concatenation/read-line result | `dr_alloc` storage, initially one reference | Copy bytes; backing reference count is unchanged |
| String array element or `string*` element | Borrowed pointer; may designate either storage kind | Copy bytes rather than retaining an unknown header |
| Null element | Null pointer | Preserve null; `dr_release(NULL)` is already safe |

`dream_string_copy` accepts a valid null-terminated string or null, allocates
`strlen(text) + 1` bytes and copies the terminator. It returns null if allocation
fails. A successful result has one reference and does not alias its input.
The input must remain readable while copying; no pointer/bounds checks are added.

Existing fall-through block cleanup releases the new local allocation. Top-level
copies remain in the allocator's registry until `dr_release_all` at shutdown.
The allocator's release/retain implementations are unchanged: only live managed
allocation addresses may be passed to them. Reading a header before an arbitrary
literal or interior pointer is invalid; the fix does not mask such errors.

## Evidence and limits

The [Dream regression](../../tests/basics/memory/indexed_string_copy.dr) checks
literal and dynamically allocated backing, nested blocks, null elements, a
top-level snapshot, and an index with a once-only side effect. The
[Go matrix](../../codex/go/indexed_strings_test.go) checks generated copy/release
code before compiling it, then requires exact output through both the direct
compiler linker and a checked-allocator harness in ordinary/module-entry modes.
The [C harness](../../codex/c/indexed_string_harness.c) checks release operands
against the real live-allocation registry before any header access, four nonnull
local releases, shutdown cleanup, and helper ownership for literal, empty, null,
managed and interior backing storage, including use after backing is freed.

This is not a complete string ownership system. For-header declarations, other initializer forms, string
reassignment, alias retention, array/pointer-local cleanup, function returns,
early return/break/continue/exception cleanup, compound expressions and field
ownership remain unqualified. Existing concatenations/read-line calls are not
wrapped in copies by this pass; their temporary/result ownership is unchanged.
Scalar string indexing and pointer shape compatibility are separate work. Direct
indexed float/char console formatting remains T010.
